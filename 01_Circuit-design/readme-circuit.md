# Ciruit design
## Hardware
This module is to design the pulse emission, system control and signal processing circuit. And finally what I expected to make is a intergration pcb, like the AFE module sold on ADI.
After reading lots of papers and researching on Kleu's ultrasound projects, I completed the following works, Version1.0 and Version2.0. Still strugling on the layout of Version2.0(On May 4th:joy:, also inspired an idea of designing a auto-layout software).

### Version1.0(Wasted)
In my first design of the control circuit, it mainly contains following blocks:
|   Title     |Components   |Description|
| ----------- | ----------- |-----------|
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |
![PCB-Version1.0](/Hardware/Version1.0/pic/Pcb-version1.0.png)

### Version2.0


### Remain works


## Emulation
## Experiment
## Reference
