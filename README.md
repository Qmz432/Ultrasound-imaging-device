# Ultrasound-imaging-device
## Overview
This project aims at designing an easy self-made ultrasound imaging device. It mainly consists of "Phased-array transducer", "Pulse-control board", and "Related algorism".And further details are below.

### Recent works and plan
### Update History
- On May 13th,2023:working on Version2.0
- On May 21st,2023:Writing the course reports, did nothing but update this Update History. Promise to finish the PCB design of Vesion2.0 in late June. /(ToT)/~~

### Overview 
This project came from the idea when I was dealing with my previous project on flexible electronics, which was mainly about sensors used to monitor beings' respiratory parameters like frequency, heart rate and so on. And I did wanna know if there existed any better solutions to further deeper gain the patients' physiological variables.

Thus I came across the idea that by detecting the diaphragm's movement and parameters can we assess his or her pulmonary conditions. Then wearable ultrasound imaging device has been this project's goal.

So far this project has only been driven by myself. And I do finish some of the work, but as I continue processing this project, the more difficulties either with the piezo-phased array, the basic design of the FPGA-minimum system, etc. I do wish someone interested in the field could join my team.

One person I appreciated much is Kelu, who open-sourced another ultrasound imaging project on GitHub and Hackaday. His success, experience and the related materials helped and inspired me a lot. But it's just confined to the circuit, wishing to have a further discussion on other fields of ultrasound imaging. And I'm tortured by the RF data recently:joy:.
