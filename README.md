# Ultrasound-imaging-device
##Overview
This project aims at designing an easy self-made ultrasound imaging device. It mainly consists of "Phased-array transducer", "Pulse-control board", and "Related algorism".And further details are below.

###Overview 
This project came from the idea when I was dealing with my previous project on flexible electronics, which was mainly about sensors used to monitor beings' respiratory parameters like frequency, heart-rate and so on. And I did wanna know if there existed any better solutions to further deeper gain the patients' physiological variables.

Thus I came across the idea that by detecting the diaphragm's movement and parameters can we assess his or her pulmonary conditions. Then wearable ultrasound imaging device has been this project's goal.



##Acknowledgements
So far this project has only been driven by myself. And I do finish some of the work, but as I continue processing this project, the more difficulties either with the piezo-phased array, the basic design of the FPGA-minimum system, etc. I do wish someone interested in the field could join my team.

One person I appreciated much is Kelu, who open-sourced another ultrasound imaging project on GitHub and Hackaday. His success, experience and the related materials helped and inspired me a lot. But it's just confined to the circuit, wishing to have a further discussion on other fields of ultrasound imaging. And I'm tortured by the RF data recently:joy:.

I'm learning about the licenses and trying to find a proper license to share this project.
